# Etch-A-Sketch
The Etch-A-Sketch application is an interactive project that allows users to create images on a digital board. Inspired by the classic drawing toy which allows for graphic creation through controlled knob movements, this digital version lets users use a mouse to draw on a square board, choosing colors and board size.
